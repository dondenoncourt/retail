<h1>Why Buy a Balance Bike ?</h1>
<p>Balance bikes have been very popular in Europe for years.  These bikes lack the pedals of a conventional bike and allow the child's feet to stay in contact with the ground.  Why are parents investing in this new type of bike?  The traditional developmental progression was for a child to start with a tricycle.  The tricycle develops the pedaling and steering skills.  Next was a bike with training wheels to help transition the child to a bike.  After some scrapped knees and elbows and a parent's sore back, the child would ride a bike without training wheels.</p>

<p>Balance bikes rewrite this developmental progression.  The name training wheels is a misnomer because training wheels do not develop static or dynamic balance.  In contrast the balance bike lets the child concentrate on developing the next skill needed to ride a bike: balance.   The pedal free design allows a child to start by walking, then running and finally coasting the balance bike.  A balance bike that has no foot pegs or wide step plate is even safer for the child.  This gradual process is natural and fun for the child and by design develops the balance skill.  This is what the new developmental progression looks like.</p>

<p>After a child has developed the pedaling and steering skills on a tricycle and developed the balance skill on a balance bike, learning to ride a bike is almost effortless.  The obvious benefits for the parents are less worry and backache!
