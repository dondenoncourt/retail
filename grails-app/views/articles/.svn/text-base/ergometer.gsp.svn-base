	<h1>What is an Ergometer?</h1>

	<p style="color:#0000FF"><b><u>What is an ergometer?</b></u></p>
	
	<p>The definition of the word ergometer is an exercise device with an apparatus for measuring the work performed by exercising.  It stems from the Greek words ergon and metron which mean work and measurer, respectively.  The term is commonly used to refer to indoor stationary rowers as well as stationary exercise bikes, although other types of exercise equipment can also be included.  While all ergometers are exercise devices, not all exercise devices are ergometers.  In fact, European countries have more stringent requirements than North American countries with regards to the measurements and the accuracy of such measurements that need to be met in order to qualify for the "ergometer" label.  To ensure the accuracy of each exercise device, KETTLER calibrates every ergometer it produces.        </p>
	
	
        <p style="color:#0000FF"><b><u>Which exercise devices can be classified as "ergometers"? </b></u></p>
	
	<p>The standards for classifying an exercise device as an ergometer is regulated in many European countries.  In order to denote an exercise device as an "ergometer", it must meet stringent standards of accuracy with regards to the amount of energy or work being applied to the unit such that it accurately corresponds to the amount of energy the computer display indicates according to the technical DIN EN 957-1/5 Class A standards. These standards are set to ensure accuracy and safety. Ergometers must be calibrated accurately in order to meet the DIN EN 957 -1/5 Class A standards whereby they qualify as exercise equipment suitable for therapeutic use in health clinics.  It is interesting to note that exercise equipment made in the USA, Taiwan and China commonly  do not meet the European standards and thus provide less accurate information on their un-calibrated computer displays.
