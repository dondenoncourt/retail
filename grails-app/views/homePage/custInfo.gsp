	      			    <p class="quote">"I wanted to relay my experience dealing with Matthew Cox today....it was extremely positive. I called this morning inquiring about information regarding the durability of your tables, as I have been tasked to investigate this for a municipal park department. Matthew was extremely knowledgeable, very patient, and pleasant. I hung up very satisfied with the answers he provided, and asked Matthew to follow up with some additional information I needed...see his email below. Not only did I receive his email almost immediately, he provided photographs that he took personally, as well as product brochures which have now convinced me to buy Kettler... a sale resulting directly from my experience with Matthew. I am involved heavily in customer service daily, and I can tell you that Mathew's performance was perfect...a RARE find today indeed.Please commend him for a job well done. Follow through means EVERYTHING today, and apparently he understands that...

It is a great bike and I get complements all the time.  The resin pedals both had a crack in them.  I emailed Kettler Parts department and they sent me new ones, ASAP.  The service is great.  I wish more people would sell this brand.  It is a nice bike from Germany.  I have already put 50 miles on the bike and it only needed a crank arm tightening.  I strongly recommend this bike specifically the Kettler Traveler series."</p>

    			    <h3>"You folks sell one heck of a machine"</h3>
    			    <p class="quote">"You folks sell one heck of a machine.  Almost four years ago my youngest brother passed away of a heart attack.  My other brother and I decided it was time to get off the couch and make a change in our lives.  I had purchased a bow flex machine about six years previous and like most I suspect, it had spent the better part of it's life as a hat and coat rack.  We decided to start using it on a regular basis.  It had a rowing feature and after researching exercising on the internet, we decided to include that feature in our routine.  Quickly a glarring problem emerged.  The rollers on the seat weren't meant to be used much.  I replaced them countless times.  Fortunately, most times, they were under warranty.  We decided to start looking for a true rowing machine.  The name Kettler appeared in almost every article we read.  I purchased a "Kadett" from amazon in feb of 2009.  We've never looked back.  All I can say is "What a machine"!  We've never changed the power settings on the pistons from the maximum 12.  At first we were lucky to do 10 minutes of strenuous rowing.  We have since settled on a 30 minute strenuous rowing workout four days a week.  At a rate of 750 to 900 strokes in 30 minutes I can't think of a better cardiovascular workout.  My brother and I are not small people, averaging about 270 lbs.  This machine is exceptionally well built.  We have replaced some pistons and a couple of straps and pedals plus two arms on it in 2 1/2 years.  The rollers still perform flawlessly.  I could not be happier with this machine.  All warranty work has been handled quickly and professionally.  Your people are the best.  The machine is built to perform.  Don't let anyone think that the "Kadett" is only for the 20 somethings.  I am 64 and my brother is 62.  Thank you for a superior product"</p>

I have an amazing little one year old who was fortunate enough to receive and awesome Kettler Tricycle for his first birthday! We had an unusual little issue with the tire and Kay took my phone call.  (I do not think she even realized how stressed I was the day I called - not just about the tire, but in general!)  Not only did Kay listen to my issue, but she explained in detail what I needed to do to remedy the situation, she took care of my issue herself, and went above and beyond to get me additional information I requested ~ immediately!!! I find it so rewarding to come across people who like to help others without being sarcastic or rude ~ this is not just a customer service thing but a life thing!! Kettler obviously has some amazing people working for them who go above and beyond what the standard may be!! Thank you Kay!!!"</p>

			    <h3>"Thank you so much for your excellent customer service"</h3>
			    <p class="quote">"Hi.  I just wanted to let you know what a great experience I had with your company.  I called a couple of weeks ago looking for a part for a Herlag child bicycle seat.  I ended up speaking with Ja'Nee.  Because the seat is about 8 years old, she had to call Germany for information about the part.  Ja'Nee obtained the information quickly and returned my call.  I ordered the part and received the item within a few days.  Unfortunately, the part was not the one I needed, and when I called to inquire, I again spoke with Ja'Nee.  Rather than trying to figure it out over the phone, Ja'Nee sent me an email with a diagram of the available parts.  I was able to locate the needed part immediately.  When I contacted her to order it, I was told that I did not need to bother sending the wrong part back and that I did not need to pay the additional $5 adjustment in price.  Quite simply, I was told that she would send the part right away, and she even gave me a tracking number.  In this day and age, to even get someone on the phone is unusual, and to get someone so helpful, knowledgeable and courteous is virtually unheard of.  Thank you so much for your excellent customer service.  I hope that Ja'Nee gets the recognition she deserves, and I will definitely be back!"</p>

I love what your Kettler car did for my daughter.  She is more energized and fit and that is why I saw my two nephews who are slowly beginning to gain wait, I figured what a wonderful toy to give over Christmas that will make them love to ride but at the same time get the perfect "exercise".
