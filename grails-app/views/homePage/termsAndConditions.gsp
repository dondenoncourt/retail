<h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>

<h1>Forms of Payment:</h1> 
<p>We currently accept VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX, DISCOVER and PAYPAL</p>

<h1>Free Shipping:</h1>  KETTLER offers free shipping on orders over $40 to the continental United States only.  The free shipping is shipped via a carrier of KETTLER's discretion but all shipments will be trackable.  For package shipments, FEDEX Ground is the primary service.  Expedited delivery services such as Next Day are provided for an additional fee.<p>

<h1>Free Inside Delivery:</h1>  When ordering $999 or more, inside delivery service will be added to your order for no additional cost.  This service will take the delivery to the first room inside a home, condominium, apartment, shed or garage.   This service will be provided to floors above or below the level accessible to the delivery vehicle ONLY when an elevator is available.  The door width must accommodate width of the package.  If you have any steps, the driver is not obligated to move the delivery over the steps but MAY assist you if you ask kindly.   This service does not include unpacking or removal of shipping material.<p>

<h1>Shipping Time:</h1>  Most FEDEX items ship from our warehouse within 2-3 business days.  Most truck shipments ship from our warehouse within 2-5 business days.  If FEDEX items are ordered with at least one truck item, the entire shipment will ship truck in 2-5 business days.  Placing separate orders for UFEDEX and truck will allow the FEDEX items to ship faster.  Shipping times can vary and are not guaranteed. We ship to the United States only.  <p>

<h1>Delivery Time:</h1> Transit time for both FEDEX and Truck is 1-5 business days.  Transit times can vary and are not guaranteed unless FEDEX Second Day or FEDEX Next Day is chosen.  Expedited delivery services such as Next Day are provided for an additional fee.  The total shipping time and delivery time is 3-8 business days for FEDEX shipments and 3-10 business days for truck shipments.   <p>

<h1>Order Tracking:</h1>  All orders ship via a carrier with tracking ability. Once an order ships from our warehouse, 
you will receive an e-mail with a tracking number.  If you created an account during checkout, 
you can access your order information including your tracking number and carrier. FEDEX orders can be tracked from our website.  
For truck orders, you can input the tracking number on the carrier's website listed below to track your order. <p>

<h1>Signature Required:</h1> All orders of $200 and above require a signature upon delivery.<p>

<h1>Delivery of Truck Shipments:</h1>  All truck shipments are for curbside delivery.  Deliveries are typically made between 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM Monday through Friday. Some trucking companies will give a 4-hour window for delivery.  Drivers are not required to lower the item to the ground, remove the item from the truck, take product inside a house, or dispose of any pallets or packaging material.  The customer is responsible for getting their product to its desired location. Your item is likely to be heavy and large; therefore, we recommend that you have someone with you to help you unload the item and carry it inside.  If you desire the trucker to assist in unloading (liftgate service) or bringing the shipment inside a first floor (inside delivery), an extra charge will be required to the trucking company and you should contact them prior to delivery to arrange the extra service.  <p>

<h1>Inspection of Truck Shipments:</h1>  Before accepting merchandise from the carrier, inspect cartons for visible signs of damage and note any loss or damage on the delivery receipt.  Any external evidence of loss or damage must be noted on the freight bill or express receipt and signed by the carrier's agent.  If any defects are found, please address with the delivery service and contact KETTLER immediately.<p>

<h1>Order Cancellation:</h1>  If you decide to cancel an order, please contact us at orders@kettlerusa.com prior to shipment.  Orders already shipped cannot be canceled. Since we strive to ship orders quickly, you may have to request a return authorization for the orders already shipped.  <p>

<h1>Return Policy:</h1>  We want you to be fully satisfied with every item that you purchase from KETTLER.  
All we require is that you send the items back to us in the original packaging and make sure that the merchandise is in new 
and unused condition.  You may return the item within 90 days of shipment for a refund of the purchase price minus the return shipping.  
If any parts are missing or defective, we will be happy to send you replacement parts at no charge. KETTLER will not pay for return shipping if parts are missing or defective.</p> 
<p>Here are the steps to the return process:</p>
<ol>
<li>All returns require prior authorization from KETTLER. To obtain a return authorization, please send us an email at orders@kettlerusa.com .  Items returned without authorization from KETTLER cannot be accepted.</li>
<li>Carefully package the item in the original packaging to ensure it is received by KETTLER in new and unused condition.  Using the RA number supplied by KETTLER, please write in 1 inch letters "RA 9999" on at least 2 sides of the return package.  </li>
<li>Contact the carrier listed in the KETTLER RA instructions. <p>
</ol>
<p>Once your return is received and inspected by KETTLER (which may take 3-5 business days), your refund will be processed and a credit will be applied to your credit card within 7-10 business days.  The cost of return freight will be deducted from your refund.  Items that are not in new and unused condition will result in a 20% restocking fee, reduced credit, or no credit. </p>

<h1>Privacy Policy:</h1>  
<p>KETTLER respects your personal information and your privacy. We think your gender, age, income, marital status and blood type is none of our business! The personal information we do collect will not be shared with outside companies except as necessary in the normal course of business (for example shipping companies in order to deliver a shipment). </p>

<h1>Parts Policy:</h1>  
<p>KETTLER backs its products with warranties for continued peace of mind.  Any missing or defective parts or warranty claims are handled by our parts department.  Please see the parts and service page for more information on contacting them directly.</p>
