For basic fun and exercise we have kids bikes, as well as women's and men's bikes. If you plan to travel a longer distance, consider a touring bike, commuter bike or one of our electric bicycles. Choose a commuter bike for those days when you want to get to the office in a hurry without the hassle of traffic or when you want to be outdoors. If you want to stow your bike in your car to take a ride while you're at work or on vacation, try a folding bike. Many of our accessories will make every bike ride more enjoyable. Consider our bike pannier, bike basket, bag or child carrier for convenience.

verbiage.bikes.accessories.p.1=Going for a bike ride is easier when you have extra room for storage of necessities like water and snacks or extra clothing to keep you warm.

The process should be as quick and hassle free as possible.

verbiage.bikes.e-bikes.p.1=In addition to having top-of-the-line components and a hydro-formed 7005 aluminum frame, all KETTLER electric bikes are equipped with the newest Panasonic manganese lithium ion rechargeable battery system, which makes riding more pleasurable. This electric bicycle battery system has a total range of more than 50 miles per charged battery (12Ah battery). Each KETTLER electric bicycle, or e-bike, also comes equipped with a security package which includes a solid frame lock integrated securely into the frame with the same key locking both the frame lock and battery securely. Just like all KETTLER bicycles, the sturdy e-bike frames are put through a 3-step powder coating process and still assembled in our own factories in Germany where they've been hand-built for more than 40 years. If you are considering hybrid bikes to make your daily rides easier or a city bike to help with your commute, consider a KETTLER bicycle.

verbiage.bikes.kids.p.1=Durability, functionality, fun and safety are particularly important to KETTLER, especially when it comes to kids bicycles. For this reason we have heavily invested in the development of new juvenile models in order to reduce bike-related risks as much as possible. We do this using hub dynamos, improved lighting and braking systems, optimized geometry and tested rigid frames.

Kids bicycles are great tools for learning balance, getting exercise and having fun.

verbiage.fitness.p.1=Get fit with KETTLER. We have been manufacturing an array of exercise equipment since 1970 to enhance your daily workout routine and make you look and feel better.

KETTLER training and exercise equipment will help your become more physically fit, help you lose weight and improve your cardiovascular system. Depending on the type of KETTLER exercise equipment you choose, you can focus on your upper body, arms, legs, stamina and overall body strength. Our durable, quiet and reliable workout and exercise equipment helps you maximize your fitness time by keeping you at home and saving time and travel to the gym, not to mention eliminating the hassle of expensive and inconvenient memberships.

verbiage.fitness.crosstrainers.p.1=Elliptical trainers are the newest low-impact exercise equipment that meets the overall need to provide a fast and effective training session without strenuous impact to the body. With elliptical trainer machines, you receive the benefits of weight bearing exercises such as jogging or running without the wear and tear on joints because your feet never leave the footplates! In addition to providing a great and effective cardiovascular workout,  KETTLER elliptical machines also offer superior fat burning benefits, even more than a treadmill. Another benefit of the elliptical trainer is that you are working out all four limbs equally, so you don't have to concentrate on a specific muscle group in your training session. The cross trainer helps you stay fit and feel better while you get an exhilarating workout on specialized exercise equipment. Since elliptical machines work out so many muscle groups simultaneously with minimal  impact, they might be the perfect exercise equipment for you.

verbiage.fitness.exercise.bikes.p.1=Cycling is one of the most effective exercises to improve stamina, reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and strokes, increase metabolism and generally improve the quality of life for people of all ages. Cycling is also an excellent aerobic conditioner that helps to build strength, boost endurance, reduce stress and lose weight. KETTLER stationary bikes offer all of these benefits without the user having to leaving the comfort and security of the indoors. Many cyclists as well as general sports enthusiasts use the low-body stress of indoor cycling to round out their fitness programs and give their whole body a complete circulatory and aerobic improvement. Using an exercise bike indoors enables those users  to fit an exercise regimen into their schedules' day or night. KETTLER offers a number of different types of exercise bicycles. The recumbent exercise bike offers easier access and a more comfortable exercise position, while the ergonomic upright exercise bike is often the choice of those involved in serious athletic training. Whatever the user's preference, KETTLER is the choice for quality, durable equipment.

verbiage.fitness.more.p.1=Whether a driven competitor or just a beginner, KETTLER has the fitness equipment and fitness equipment accessories for you. The Montana Stepper has all of the important features of a stepper found in a club, but it is still easy enough for the casual user to operate. Our Apollo Inversion Table provides stress relief for lumbar discs, from the novice to professional athlete. The World Tours software is both challenging for the pro rider and entertaining enough for the common cyclist to enjoy. KETTLER's exercise equipment mats prevent damage and absorb vibration.
verbiage.fitness.rowers.p.1=Rowing is one of the best full-body workouts because it challenges every major muscle group of the body. KETTLER Rowing machines help to strengthen and tone the muscular system while at the same time providing an excellent cardiovascular workout. Rowing machines also offer a well-balanced form of stamina training which improves the performance of both the circulatory and respiratory system. Rowing also improves and maintains flexibility and is impact free. Rowers also provide an excellent way to lose weight, burn calories and rehabilitate muscles, ligaments and joints while also helping to relieve stress. Whether you are a novice or personal trainer, young or old, KETTLER rowers offer the perfect workout suitable for all ages and skill levels.

verbiage.fitness.treadmills.p.1=A regular cardiovascular workout is key to any weight loss program and KETTLER home treadmills are unsurpassed in making this possible.

The relaxed retro design of the aluminum frame, 3-piece crank set, and swept back, cruiser style handlebar allows the rider to easily pedal from a restful upright position.  The extra wide padded saddle with support springs is more than enough to soften any bump in the road.  Full length metal fenders and a chainguard make leisure riding clean and enjoyable.  Dual sided pedals allow a sure grip no matter what your footwear.  The large front basket on the women's model is generous enough to carry virtually anything while the handlebar mounted beverage holder on the men's model will accommodate any preferred beverage.  The Verso Capri will deliver a riding experience of a laid back, carefree summer day.
